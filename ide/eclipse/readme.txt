If you had checked the ARK project to <ark_root> then in Eclipse, go to

Window / Preferences > General > Workspace > Linked Resources > Path Variables

create the following variables

ARK_DATA = <ark_root>/persistence
ARK_JAVA = <ark_root>/platforms/java

To resolve project source references.
